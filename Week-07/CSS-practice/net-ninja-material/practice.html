      <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
        the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
        shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of
        the ones that became nothing.

        The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
        men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
        darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
        thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you
        will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
